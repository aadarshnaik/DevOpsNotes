IAM
----------
IAM = Identity and Access Management
Root account created by default, should't be used or shared
Users and people within your organization and can be grouped
Groups only contains users, not other groups
Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

IAM: Permissions
    Users or groups can be assigned JSON doccuments called policies
    These policies define the permission of the users
    In AWS you apply the least privilege principle: don't give more permission than a user needs
