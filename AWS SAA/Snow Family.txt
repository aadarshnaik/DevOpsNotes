AWS Snow Family
-----------------
Highly-secure, portable devices to collect and process data at the edge, and migrate data into and out of AWS

Data Migration - Snowcone, Snowball Edge, Snowmobile

Edge Computing - Snowcone, Snowball Edge

Data Migration with AWS Snow Family
	Time it takes to transfer data, it may take a lot of time so we use AWS snow family
	
	Challenges with normal Data transfer
		Limited connectivity
		Limited Bandwidth
		High network cost
		Shared bandwidth (can't maximize the line)
		Connection stability
	AWS Snow family: Offline devices to perform data migrations
	If it takes more then a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices!

Snowcone and Snowcone SSD
	Small, portable computing, anywhere, rugged and secure, withstands harsh environments
	Light (4.5 pounds, 2.1 kg)
	Device used for edge computing, storage and data transfer
	Snowcone - 8TB of HDD Storage
	Snowcone SSD - 14TB of SSD Storage
	Use Snowcone where Snowball does not fit (space-constrained enviironment)
	Must provide your own battery / cables
	Can be sent back to AWS offline, or connect it to internet and use AWS DataSync to send data


Snowball Edge (for data transfers)
	Physical data transport solution: move TBs or PBs of data in or out of AWS
	Alternative to moving data over the network (and paying network fees)
	Pay per data transfer job
	Provide block storage and Amazon-s3-compatible object storage
	Snowball Edge Storage Optimized
		80TB of HDD Capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage
	Snowball Edge Compute Optimized
		42TB of HDD Capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage
	Use cases: large data cloud migrations, DC decommission, disaster recovery


AWS Snowmobile
	Transfers exabytes of data (1EB = 1000PB = 1000000TBs)
	Each Snowmobile has 100PB of capacity 
	High Security: temperature controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance
	Better than Snowball if you transfer more than 10PB


Snow Family - Usage Process
	1. Request Snowball devices from the AWS console for delivery
	2. Install the snowball client / AWS OpsHub on your servers
	3. Connect the snowball to your servers and copy files using the client
	4. Ship back the device when you're done (goes to the right AWS facility)
	5. Data will be loaded into an S3 bucket
	6. Snowball is completely wiped

Edge Computing using Snow Family
	Process data while its being created on an edge location
		A truck on the road, a ship on the sea, a mining station underground
	These Locations may have
		Limited/no internet access
		Limited/no easy access to computing power
	We setup a Snowball Edge / Snowcone device to do edge computing
	Use cases of Edge Computing:
		Preprocess data
		Machine learning at the edge
		Transcoding media streams
	Eventually (if need be) we can ship back the device to AWS (for transferring data for example)
Snow Family - Edge Computing
	Snowcone and Snowcone SSD (smaller)
		2 CPUs, 4 GB of memory, wired or wireless access
		USB-C power using a cord or the optional battery
	Snowball Edge - Compute Optimized
		52 vCPUs, 208 GiB of RAM
		Optional GPU (useful for video processing or machine learning)
		42 TB usable storage
	Snowball Edge - Storage Optimized
		Upto 40 vCPUs, 80 GiB of RAM
		Object storage clustering available
	All: Can run EC2 Instances & AWS Lambda functions (using AWS IoT Greengrass)
	Long-term deployment options: 1 and 3 years discounted pricing

AWS OpsHub
	Historically, to use Snow Family devices, you needed a CLI (Command Line Interface tool)
	Today you can use AWS OpsHub (a software you install on your computer/laptop to 
	manage your Snow Family Device)
		Unlocking and configuring single or clustered devices
		Transferring files
		Launching and managing instances running on Snow Family Devices
		Monitor device metrics (storage capacity, active instances on your device)
		Launch compatible AWS services on your devices (ex: Amazon EC2 instances, AWS DataSync, Network File System (NFS)
