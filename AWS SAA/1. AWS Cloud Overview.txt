AWS Regions
------------
AWS has Regions all around the world

A region is a cluster of data centers
Most AWS services are region-scoped

How to choose an AWS Region?
- Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
- Proximity to customers: reduced latency
- Available services within a Region: new services and features aren't available in every Region
- Pricing: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page

AWS Availability Zone
----------------------
Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 2, max is 6). Example:
	ap-southeast-2a
	ap-southeast-2b
	ap-southeast-2c
Each Availability zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
They're seperate from each other, so that they're isolated from disasters.
They're connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking

Amazon has 216 Points of Presence (205 Edge Locations & Locations & Regional Caches) in 84 cities across 42 countries
