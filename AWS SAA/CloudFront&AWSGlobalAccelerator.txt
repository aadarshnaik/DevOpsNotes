AWS CloudFront
----------------
Content Delivery Network (CDN)
Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge
Improves users experience
216 Point of Presence globally (edge locations)
DDoS protection (because worldwide), integration with Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall

CloudFront - Origins
    S3 bucket
        For distributing files and caching them at the edge
        Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)
        OAC is replacing Origin Access Identity (OAI)
        CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)

    Custom Origin (HTTP)
        Application Load Balancer
        EC2 instance
        S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website)
        Any HTTP backend you want    

CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication
    CloudFront:
        Global Edge network
        Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
        Great for static content that must be available everywhere
    
    S3 Cross Region Replication:
        Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
        Files are updated in the real-time
        Read only
        Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions


CloudFront and S3 Hands-On:
    MyBucket (private). We can use cloudFront to make these files accessible without making them public
    CloudFront > Origin Domain(select s3) > Origin access control > Create control settings > Default root object - index.html >
    Update the policy created by Origin Access Policy in S3 Bucket 


CloudFront Geographic Restriction
    You can restrict who can access your distribution
        Allowlist: Allow your users to access your your content only if they're in one of the countries on a list of approved countries
        Blocklist: Prevent your users from accessing your content in they're in one of the countries on a list of banned countries
    The "country" is determined using 3rd party Geo-IP database
    Use case: Copyright Laws to control access to content

CloudFront - Pricing
    We can reduce the number of edge locations for cost reduction
    Three price classes:
        Price Class All: all regions - best performance
        Price Class 200: most regions, but excludes the most expensive regions
        Price Class 100: only the least expensive regions

CloudFront - Cache Invalidations
    In case you update the back-end origin, CloudFront doesn't know about it and will only get the refreshed content after TTL has expired
    However we can force an entire or partial cacherefresh (thus bypassing the TTL) by performing a CloudFront Invalidation
    You can invalidate all files (*) or a special path (/images/*)


Global Accelerator
----------------------
    We have deployed an application and have global users who want to access it directly
    They go over the public internet, which can add a lot of latency due to many hops
    We wish to go as fast as possible through AWS network to minimize latency
    Unicast IP
        Unicast IP is one server holds one IP address
    Anycast IP:
        All servers hold the same IP address and the client is routed to the nearest one
    Global Accelerator uses Anycast IP to connect to nearest server

    Global Accelerator Leverage the AWS internal network to route to application
    2 Anycast IP are created for your application
    The Anycast IP sends traffic directly to Edge Locations
    The Edge locations send the traffic to your application

    AWS Global Accelerator
        Works with Elastic IP, EC2 instances, ALB, NLB, public or private
        Consistent Performance
            Intelligent routing to lowest latency and faster regional failover
            No issue with client cache (because IP doesn't change)
            Internal AWS network
        Health Checks
            Global Accelerator performs a health check of your applications
            Helps make your application global (failover less than 1 min for unhealthy)
            Great for disaster recovery(thanks to health checks)
        Security
            only 2 external IP need to be whitelisted
            DDoS protection thanks to AWS Shield
    
    AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
        They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
        Both services integrate the AWS Shield for DDoS protection
        CloudFront
            Improves performance for both cacheble content (images and videos)
            Dynamic Content (Such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery)
            Content is served at the edge
        Global Accelerator
            Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
            Proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions
            Good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT(MQTT), or Voice over IP
            Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
            Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover
	Hands-On:
		We setup our EC2 instances in 2 zones
		Global Accelerator > Enter name > Listerner(Port 80, Protocal TCP for HTTP traffic >
		Endpoint groups (Enter the % of traffic we want in a region) > Health Checks > Add endpoint >
		Create accelerator
