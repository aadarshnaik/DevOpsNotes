Linux Basics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux Principles

- Everything is a file(Including Hardware)
- Small Single purpose Programs
- Ability to chain programs together for complex operations
- Avoid Captive User Interface
- Configuration data stored in text file

RPM based :- RHEL, Centos, Oracle Linux, Amazon Linux
Debian :- Ubuntu Server, Kali Linux



Directories :-
-------------------------

- Home Directories: /root, /home/username
- User Executable: /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin
- System Executable: /sbin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/sbin
- other mountpoints: /media, /mnt
- Configuration: /etc
- Temporary Files: /tmp
- Kernels and Bootloader: /boot
- Server Data: /var, /srv
- System Information: /proc, /sys
- Shared Libraries: /lib, /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib

To get operating system info we use
$cat /etc/os-release

#/boot/initramfs-3.10.0-1160.el7.x86_64.img => Bootloader
#/boot/vmlinuz-3.10.0-1160.el7.x86_64 => kernel

# cd /boot/grub2/ => Configuration for booting

# cd /proc/
proc# uptime => to see uptime and how many users are logged in. 

Command   options   arguments
cp 		-r	  dev bakupdir/
ls
ls 		-l	  /tmp/



Vim Editor
------------------
3 modes in vim editor
- command mode
- insert mode
- extended mode

: in vim editor -> extended mode
esc in vim editor -> command mode

:se nu => to get line numbers on vim editor
Shift + g to go to last line
Shift + GG to go to first line
yy to copy any line y means yanking
p to paste below 
P to paste above
dd is to delete lines
yy + p => copy paste
dd + p => cut paste
u to undo in command mode



Files in Linux
---------------------
#file yum -> to know the file type

- Regular File   for Normal files such as text, data or executable
d Directory      for Files that are lists of other files
l Link     	     for a shortcut that points to the location of the actual file
c Special file   for mechanism used for input and output, such as files in /dev
s Socket         for a special file that provides inter process networking protected by the file system's access control.
p Pipe           for a special file that allows processes to communicate with each other without using network socket semantics.

to make interdirectory using mkdir
mkdir -p /opt/dev/ops/devops/test

To change hostname
	#vim /etc/hostname
	#hostname centos7.devops.in

ln -s <originalFilePath> <LinkFilePath> is used to create softlink/Link



Filters and redirection
--------------------------
# grep firewall <filename>
grep -i firewall <filename> => IgnoreCaseSensitivity
< is for input redirection symbol
	eg. grep -i firewall < filename.cfg
for Directory
# grep -iR firewall *
-R is used for directory

# grep -R SELINUX /etc/*
# grep -vi <keyword> <filename> => Opposive search

less & more are file reader. we use q to quit
#head <filename> => to see first 10 lines.
#head -20 <filename> => to see first 20 lines.

#tail <filename> => last 10 lines of a file
#tail -2 <filename> => last 2 lines of a file

#tail -f filepath => dynamic content

to check logs => /var/log/
tail -f /var/log/messages => log files of OS dynamically

-d delimiters are colon or comma (: or ,)
To get data from a file properly segregated by delimiters we can use cut to get data

# cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd

f1 is field1/column1

for cut command delimiters are very important

#awk -F':' '{print $1}' /etc/passwd
$1,$2,$3 are columns

Search and Replace =>

Inside the file:
	:%s/coronavirus/covid19/g
	g means globally

	If we replace a keyword with nothing the keyword is omitted
	:%s/covid19//g
Outside the file:
	To see the file:
		sed 's/coronavirus/covid19/g' samplefile.txt
		sed 's/coronavirus/covid19/g' *
	To change the content:
		sed -i 's/coronavirus/covid19/g' samplefile.txt



I/O Redirection
----------------
# uptime > /tmp/sysinfo.txt
# free -m => Memory utilization (RAM)
# df -h => Space Utilization
# date for date Information
# df -kh => List out the file systems.
# df -sch /<mount_point> to select.

If we dont want to see output we can redirect to to /dev/null/. Its a blackhole
to clear all contents of a file we can use /dev/null

#cat /dev/null > /tmp/sysinfo.txt  => wipes sysinfo.txt file clean

freeeee -m 2 >> /tmp/error.log => 2 is for standard error.
& >> is to redirect and append all the output to file (Output and Error both)

wc -l => To count lines

# ls | wc -l
# ls | grep host

#find /etc -name host

#yum install mlocate -y
# updatedb
#locate <keyword>



Users and Groups
------------------------
Username  LinkToShadowFile userid groupid comment homeDir          loginShell
--------  ---------------- ------ ------- ------- -------          ----------
root     :  x             :  0   :   0   :root   :/root          : /bin/bash
vagrant  :  x		  : 1000 : 1000  :vagrant:/home/vagrant  : /bin/bash

User info file is /etc/passwd and group info file is /etc/group

all groups /etc/group

useradd ansible
useradd jenkins
useradd aws

groupadd devops

To add users to group 

	usermod -aG devops ansible
	-G is for secondary/supplementary group
	-g is for primary group
We can directly edit the group file also
	vim /etc/group

#passwd username => To give password to users
root user can reset any users password by using passwd username command, 
also user can reset its own password by running just passwd command

users password is stored in /etc/shadows file.

#last to see users logged in to the system

lsof will list all opened files by the current user
#lsof -u vagrant

To delete a user
#userdel <username>
To remove an user 
#userdel -r jenkins

To delete a group
#groupdel devops



File permissions
--------------------
r => read
w => write
x => execute

- => filetype
rw- => User
--- => group
--- => others


To check file permissions for directory we can use #ls -ld /opt/devopsdir

We create 4 user and 1 group
useradd ansible
useradd jenkins
useradd aws
useradd miles
groupadd devops

[root@centos opt]# id jenkins
uid=1002(jenkins) gid=1003(jenkins) groups=1003(jenkins),1001(devops)
[root@centos opt]# id ansible
uid=1001(ansible) gid=1002(ansible) groups=1002(ansible),1001(devops)
[root@centos opt]# id aws
uid=1003(aws) gid=1004(aws) groups=1004(aws),1001(devops)
[root@centos opt]# id miles
uid=1004(miles) gid=1005(miles) groups=1005(miles)
[root@centos opt]#


To add a user in sudo privilages. Th file is in /etc/sudoers

# visudo - 
line 100 around add the user like root

100 root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL
101 ansible ALL=(ALL)      NOPASSWD:ALL

NOPASSWD is added to /etc/sudoers so that it doesnt ask password while
switching to root user.

sudo -i cannot by used by all users for root user. we need to add users 
in /etc/sudoers or /etc/sudoers.d

curl command is used to access a link or download content also
[root@centos ~]# curl https://rpmfind.net/linux/centos/7.9.2009/os/x86_64/Packages/tree-1.6.0-10.el7.x86_64.rpm -o tree-1.6.0-10.el7.x86_64.rpm

To install package:
	rpm -ivh tree-1.6.0-10.el7.x86_64.rpm

to list all the packages to install
	rpm -qa
to erase a package 
	rpm -e <rpm name>

better option to download and install package is yum. It does by using some configuration file/
yum repository is located at  ===>	cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
apt repository is located at  ===>  /etc/apt/sources.list & /etc/apt/sources.list.d

To install packages we use 
rpm -i packagename in RedHat OS
dpkg -i packagename in Debian OS




Services
------------
# yum instal httpd

httpd can be managed by systemctl command

systemctl status httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl restart httpd
systemctl reload httpd

To get a service at boot time 
#systemctl enable httpd

To check ssh status
#systemctl status sshd

To check if a service is active
#systemctl is-active httpd
#systemctl is-enabled httpd




Processes
----------------
# top => Task Manager in Windows -- Dynamic
# ps aux -- Static Task Manager

[root@centos ~]# ps -ef | grep httpd
root      1570     1  0 18:14 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND
apache    1571  1570  0 18:14 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND
apache    1572  1570  0 18:14 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND
apache    1573  1570  0 18:14 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND
apache    1574  1570  0 18:14 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND
apache    1575  1570  0 18:14 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND
root      1587  1328  0 18:28 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto httpd
[root@centos ~]# kill 1570
[root@centos ~]# ps -ef | grep httpd
root      1595  1328  0 18:29 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto httpd

To forcefully shutdown a process we use

[root@centos ~]# kill -9 1570

Filtering and force Kill :
[root@centos ~]# ps -ef | grep httpd | grep -v 'grep' | awk '{print $2}'
1603
1604
1605
1606
1607
1608
[root@centos ~]# ps -ef | grep httpd | grep -v 'grep' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
[root@centos ~]#

To check processes with their parent process id we use 
#ps -ef

A child process that remains running even after its parent process is terminated or completed without waiting for child process execution
is called a Orphan process. Zombie process that has completed its task but still, it shows an entry in a process table 




Archiving
-------------
To compress and tar we use:
# tar -czvf jenkins_26042022.tar.gz jenkins

To extract
# tar -xzvf jenkins_26042022.tar.gz
To extract it somewhere else:
# tar -xzvf jenkins_26042022.tar.gz -C /opt/

To zip:
yum install zip unzip -y

zip -r jenkins_26042022.zip jenkins
unzip jenkins_26042022.zip


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ctrl + Z to stop/freeze a process

sort command in linux happens based on ascii dictionary

If a file has integers and we give sort file_name, it will sort in ascii order
to make it numeric sorting we can do sort -n file_name

cat listofitems.txt | uniq -> to get unique list but unique elements should be adjacent to each other
